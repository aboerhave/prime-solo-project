# Parks & Coasters

## Description

Duration: 2 weeks 11/16/2020 - 12/1/2020

I am a big fan of amusement parks and theme parks, as a former ride operator at Valleyfair! and cast member at the Walt Disney World Resort.  I had a season pass to Valleyfair multiple summers when I was a teenager, and had an annual pass for Universal Orlando for many years when I lived in Florida.  I have also had multiple visits the last few years to parks in places like Southern California, the Orlando area, and a road trip through Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio last summer.  Unfortunately, I do not remember exactly what I did on many of my visits to these places.

This app is an easy way to record specifically what is done during a day at a theme park, by selecting a park for a certain day and incrementing the number of times an attraction has been experienced as the user goes about their day.  Additional notes about the day may also be added.  It then saves a list of prior trips and is a great way to revisit what was done previously to bring back memories, as well as shape future trips to that location.

There were a fair number of challenges to get the app completed.  One of the biggest that I overcame was the functionality to save the notes in the text box.  I made a typo that took about 36 hours to find.  I thought I had fixed it and found another issue five days later.  Now it works great.  Also, it became difficult to keep track of all of the reducers and server routes.  The planning was sufficient for wireframes and database tables, but in the future, I will need to include more planning for sagas and reducers, and server routes.
